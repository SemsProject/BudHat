Welcome to Trac 0.12.5 
=======================
Trac is a **minimalistic** approach to **web-based** management of
**software projects**. Its goal is to simplify effective tracking and handling of software issues, enhancements and overall progress.

All aspects of Trac have been designed with the single goal to 
**help developers write great software** while **staying out of the way**
and imposing as little as possible on a team's established process and
culture.

As all Wiki pages, this page is editable, this means that you can
modify the contents of this page simply by using your
web-browser. Simply click on the "Edit this page" link at the bottom
of the page. /WikiFormatting will give you a detailed description of
available Wiki formatting commands.

"[w/TracAdmin trac-admin] *yourenvdir* initenv" created
a new Trac environment, containing a default set of wiki pages and some sample
data. This newly created environment also contains 
[documentation](//TracGuide) to help you get started with your project.

You can use [w/TracAdmin trac-admin] to configure
[Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) to better fit your project, especially in
regard to *components*, *versions* and *milestones*. 


/TracGuide is a good place to start.

Enjoy! [None](BR)
