BudHat
======

**BudHat** is our approach to implement a version control system for computational models. It is a web interface where registered users are able to upload their models. Uploaded models can be published and shared with others.

BudHat uses [BiVeS](http://sems.uni-rostock.de/trac/bives/wiki) to detect differences between certain versions of a model. The output of BiVeS is presented as an XML dump and we also implemented a method to visualize these changes in the reaction network of the model.
